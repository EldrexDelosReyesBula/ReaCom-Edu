        <h3>Important Notice</h3>
        <p>
            This documentation serves as an overview for the ReaCom Edu trial, conducted by the ReaCom team as part of their Practical Research 2 paper. All data gathered, analyzed, or tested during this trial must adhere to established ethical guidelines and legal requirements. Participation in the trial is contingent upon the informed consent of students and teachers, ensuring transparency and voluntary involvement. 
            Additionally, it is important to note that due to budget constraints and API restrictions, certain features of the ReaCom Edu app may not function as intended or may be unavailable during the trial period. Any misuse or unauthorized use of this documentation or the ReaCom Edu app may result in legal repercussions.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The ReaCom Edu app is a digital tool created to improve the academic performance of students by providing easily accessible and user-friendly educational resources. This trial aims to evaluate the app's impact on students’ academic progress at Dolores National High School, located in Dolores, Eastern Samar, Philippines. By assessing how well the app supports students in their academic endeavors, the trial seeks to determine whether integrating technology can enhance the learning experience, offering students new tools for effective study and self-paced learning.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <p>
            The main objectives of the ReaCom Edu trial are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>To assess the impact of the ReaCom Edu app on students’ academic performance, comparing grades and test scores.</li>
            <li>To evaluate the differences in test scores between students who use the app and those who rely on traditional study methods.</li>
            <li>To measure the level of engagement students report when utilizing the app, considering aspects such as usability, interaction with educational content, and perceived academic benefits.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These objectives will be pursued through both quantitative and qualitative data collection methods, aiming to provide a well-rounded analysis of the app's potential educational benefits.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>
            The research follows a quasi-experimental design, utilizing two distinct groups: an experimental group that will actively use the ReaCom Edu app and a control group that will continue with their standard learning methods. To measure the effectiveness of the app, pre-tests will be administered to establish baseline academic performance, and post-tests will be conducted after the trial period to evaluate any improvements in academic outcomes. In addition to these tests, surveys and interviews will be conducted to gather qualitative insights into the students' experiences, engagement levels, and any challenges they encountered while using the app.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>
            The data collection for this trial will be comprehensive, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative methods to gauge the effectiveness of the app. The following methods will be used:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pre-test and Post-test:</strong> These tests will assess students’ academic performance before and after the trial to identify any improvements or changes attributed to the use of the app.</li>
            <li><strong>Surveys:</strong> Surveys will collect feedback from students and teachers regarding their experiences with the app, focusing on usability, frequency of use, and perceived academic benefits.</li>
            <li><strong>Interviews:</strong> One-on-one interviews with students and teachers will provide deeper insights into the users’ experiences, challenges, and suggestions for improvement.</li>
            <li><strong>App Usage Logs:</strong> The app will track how frequently students access learning materials, how long they engage with the app, and which features they use most, allowing the ReaCom team to measure interaction levels and identify potential areas for improvement.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Legal and Ethical Considerations</h2>
        <p>
            All participants in the trial must provide informed consent before being involved. This ensures that participants are aware of the study’s purpose, procedures, and potential risks. It is crucial to emphasize that all data collected will be kept confidential and used exclusively for the purposes of this research. The ReaCom team will ensure that all practices align with local and international data protection laws, including the Philippines’ Data Privacy Act of 2012.
